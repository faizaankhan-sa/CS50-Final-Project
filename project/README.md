How was the project executed?
This project was completed by myself with the knowledge I gained from the CS50 course. There were times when I did encounter problems however I overcame them with the help of Google.

What new skills did I have to learn?
Fortunately, I did not have to learn any needed skills when creating this web app as CS50 thought me the necessary skills to be able to accomplish this project.

How long did the project take me?
I was planning on finishing this project in one day however I did encounter problems that held me back however this was not a major issue as I just problem-solved my way through the project.

What is the tech stack that was used for the project?
I made use of Flask and SQLAlchemy. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper for the Python programming language released under the MIT License.

What improvements could I make to the app?
The current version of this web app is an MVP (minimum viable product) that allows users to do basic note-taking. There are definitely improvements that can be made in terms of the UI (user interface) and UX (user experience). Improvements can also be made in terms of allowing users to add images to their note-taking process. A calendar feature can also be added that will allow users to make reminders.

What inspired me to make a note-taking web app?
I have always made use of note-taking apps so I thought I would make my own one for my final CS50 project. I am glad that I did as I learned a tremendous amount about the way these types of apps work from the front-end to the back-end.

What is a web app?
A Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface. Web services are Web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain Web apps. According to Web.AppStorm editor Jarel Remick, any website component that performs some function for the user qualifies as a Web app.

Why did I make a web app?
The reason I decided to make a web app is that users don't need to install the software. Web apps can be accessed through various platforms such as a desktop, laptop, or mobile.
